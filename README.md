# 🌆 Navapura — City Design Project (DAA)

**Navapura** is a conceptual smart city created as part of the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** coursework.  
This project explores systematic city planning using zoning, transport optimization, sustainability principles, and human-centric urban development.

## 📌 Project Overview

Navapura aims to be:

- **Sustainable** — green corridors, renewable energy, water conservation  
- **Efficient** — optimized road network, minimal commute distances  
- **Connected** — multi-modal transport (MRT, buses, cycle paths)  
- **Livable** — mixed-use neighborhoods and public spaces  

The website displays the complete planning process, maps, layouts, designs, and features of Navapura.
